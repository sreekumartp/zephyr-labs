# Kconfig for the Event Bus component

choice EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBER_TYPE
    prompt "Event Bus Subscriber Mechanism"
    default EVENT_BUS_USE_CALLBACK
    help
      Select the subscriber mechanism for the event bus. This choice
      is mutually exclusive.

    config EVENT_BUS_USE_POLLING
        bool "Polling (Message Queue) based subscribers"
        help
          This option enables a dispatcher thread that forwards events
          to subscriber-specific message queues. Each subscriber must
          have its own thread to poll its queue.

    config EVENT_BUS_USE_CALLBACK
        bool "Callback (Work Queue) based subscribers"
        help
          This option enables a system where callbacks are registered
          and executed from a dedicated worker thread pool (work queue).
          This is generally more memory efficient as subscribers do not
          need their own dedicated threads.
